# Weather-App

Created the framework, and formatted it using html and css, then using an event listener upon pressing the search button. After the event listener, call the event to find the longitude and latitude, based on the location that is enterred. Afterwords, using the longitude and latitude, so I can use that, to find the weather for the next 5 days. Saving the data into the local storage, and listing the searched cities beneath the search bar.
